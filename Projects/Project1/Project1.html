    <li>It felt really smooth and bright. There were lots of bright colors that caught my attention and for the most part it was pretty ogranized as well.</li>
    <li>All and all, the site did flow very well it was all very linear and had all the categories needed. There were links and also click tabs that would then redirect you to get more information. It felt very smooth.</li>
    <li>I think so i didn't really feel confused at all, I felt like I could find my way around the problem. It was pretty basic to keep it honest.</li>
    <li>I rearlly didn't think so, I felt like it was the perfect amount. It was a retail site, so it did enough to keep my attention and want me to move forward and hoepfully buy something.</li>
    <li>It was instant, I honestly didn't even have to wait at all. It was great.</li>
    <li>It was actually updated to follow the season that is going on during the year. So it was fall theme it was sweet. I thoguht that it was perfect and caught my attention</li>
    <li>It had both, it had the main navigation and then it also had like a sub navigator, where we could find things per categories. It was pretty easy to work around</li>
    <li>It sure did, it was based on the season that was going on. So it was very fall themed, which at the same time was also good marketing.</li>
    <li>I think it was pretty good, can't say I know too much of a diffrence but it felt pretty respansive, without and delay or lag.</li>
    <li>The interactive part of it was really cool. I felt like there were lots of buttons that you could click that would redirect you to other sites and it was really well done.</li>

    <li>Well I mean to start off it was not even refreshing, it was sayying there was an error. I didn't do anything but go to the home page.</li>
    <li>It felt find, it was pretty minimal. They really only had a little amount of catergories, and that was it.</li>
    <li>Yeah it makes sense, seems like it's a website that is staight to the point, so it was pretty broad, so not really impressed.</li>
    <li>It does, it is straight to the point, and the strucutre of it is divded into caterogies that tie to national parks in utah. So it's pretty simple.</li>
    <li>To start there isn't really much, it's a singual foto that doesn't really make too much of a diffrece in my opinon</li>
    <li>It loaded quick but there was nothing to really refresh.</li>
    <li>Yup it had a section tab and navigation, so it was easy to find what was needed.</li>
    <li>It responded fine, can't say that I noticed too much of a diffrence when it was smaller</li>
    <li>Not going to lie, I wasn't really imperssed by this. The photo was great, but that was about it.</li>
